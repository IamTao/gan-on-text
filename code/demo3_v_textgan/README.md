A demo for sentence generation based on various datasets, e.g., BBC, Shakespeare.

Note that we create different types of data loader. For clarification, the file name that ended by captial `V` represents that we will pad the sentence into a fixed sentence length. Otherwise, we will directly split a sequence of words by a given sentence length.
